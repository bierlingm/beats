# Design Exploration Capture Tool

## The Problem

Design exploration generates valuable knowledge that gets lost:
- Iteration files pile up without context
- Decision rationale lives only in memory/chat logs  
- Dead ends disappear (but contained learning)
- The "why" behind pivots isn't captured
- Stakeholders only see final artifact, miss the journey

## The Insight

The moritzbierling.com pack metaphor evolution demonstrated this:
- v1: Basic pack interior concept
- v2: Enhanced frame, MOLLE webbing  
- v3: Layered compartments (back/middle/front)
- v4: Closed pack with openable pockets
- v5: Pack as CHARACTER - sensory details, restraint

Each step had **intent** and **learning**. The journey from "just stack desktop elements" to "pack is a character not a container" is the real value.

## What a Tool Could Do

1. **Track iteration relationships** - parent/child, branches, merges
2. **Capture decision rationale** - why this direction? what was learned?
3. **Mark pivots and breakthroughs** - flag significant moments
4. **Visualize exploration tree** - see the path, not just endpoints
5. **Export narratives** - generate explainable stories for stakeholders
6. **Link to artifacts** - connect rationale to actual files

## Core Metaphor

"Git for design thinking" - but focused on the WHY not just the WHAT.

Git tracks file changes. This tracks *decision changes* and *understanding evolution*.

## Prior Art to Research

- Design version control (Abstract, Figma history)
- Decision logs / ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Research journals / lab notebooks
- Zettelkasten for creative process

## Next Steps

- [ ] Sketch data model (exploration, iteration, decision, artifact)
- [ ] Prototype CLI for capturing iterations
- [ ] Design visualization approach
- [ ] Consider integration with existing tools (git, bv, bd)
